            <span class="dropcap">T</span>his reading reflection is the first of
            (hopefully) many in a series I’m calling Data Viz Diaries. I hope
            you’ll find some entertainment in my ramblings and are inspired to
            pick up each text yourself to expand your knowledge of visual
            communication. Let’s jump in.
          </p>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <p>
            In The <em>Visualization of Quantitative Information</em>, I found Tufte’s
            voice to be technical yet welcoming, with some phrases actually
            making me laugh out loud. “The only worse design than a pie chart is
            several of them” (p. 178) was one of those phrases. He states pie
            graphs are ineffective because tables are a better way to show exact
            numbers in a small dataset. I was never a fan of tables until I read
            his book, but it tracks, especially considering Alberto Cairo’s
            approach to visualization techniques.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a lecture I attended, Cairo referenced an excerpt from Tamara
            Muzner’s <em>Visual Analysis and Design</em> to explain the most effective
            ways of comparing information — position on a common scale was at
            the top of the list, and volume (3D models) was at the bottom, with
            angles (which is how pie charts compare data) coming in at number
            four out of ten. While pie charts aren’t the absolute worst way to
            communicate according to Muzner’s list, the information they display
            can be better expressed through bar charts, or, as Tufte writes,
            tables.
          </p>
          <img
            class="entry-image"
            src="../images/data-viz-diaries/entry-1/kramers-shelves_v004.png"
            alt="A graphic showing the comparison of book cover colors between romance and horror genres. Out of 84 books, 26 romance book covers are blue, while out of 83 books, 47 horror covers are black."
          />
          <p class="caption">
            A graphic I made about the book covers in a local D.C. bookstore,
            featuring two pie graphs that could've been a bar chart or better
            yet, a table. (Amanda Weisbrod)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I feel the urge to experiment more with tables in small datasets
            from now on, perhaps embedding “sparklines” or small,
            high-resolution graphics (p. 172) within to give them depth and a
            way to easily compare trends. Tufte states that visual communication
            is second nature to humans and can convey information in a fraction
            of a second compared to words alone. Our eyes immediately search for
            patterns and can determine variances in those patterns instinctively
            as a result of our evolution. This is why visual communication is so
            important — conveying data and stories in this way allows readers to
            comprehend complex ideas at a glance. And for the more intricate
            graphics, allow for exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, to me, tables could be great for small datasets if the
            intention is for the reader to explore the exact numbers; otherwise,
            graphical visualizations are better. It all depends on the purpose
            of your design. “What are you trying to communicate? What are you
            hoping your readers will learn?” These are the first questions I ask
            myself when designing graphics, and the follow-up is “How can I make
            this more interesting?”
          </p>
          <p>
            I struggle with designing innovative graphics that break the rules.
            I find myself leaning on bar charts and line graphs more often than
            not. While I know there’s nothing wrong with these tried-and-true
            approaches, I hope, in the future, to create more engaging and
            revolutionary designs. But Tufte stresses it’s important not to let
            the design get in the way of the data. He writes about “maximizing
            data-ink,” or the practice of communicating as much information in
            as little ink as possible by avoiding “chart-junk,” or non/redundant
            data-ink. Examples of chart-junk include unintentional optical art,
            the “dreaded” grid, and the self-promoting graphical duck.
          </p>
          <p>
            A graphical duck is when a graphic is taken over by decoration. Once
            I read the definition, this example came to mind:
          </p>
          <img
            class="entry-image"
            src="../images/data-viz-diaries/entry-1/diamonds-graph.jpg"
            alt="An image of the cover of Edward Tufte's book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"
          />
          <p class="caption">
            A photograph of Nigel Holmes' "Diamonds were a girl's best friend"
            graphic from Edward Tufte's book, Envisioning Information. (Amanda
            Weisbrod)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Here, we see not only is this chart sexualizing data (weird), but
            its decoration is getting in the way of communicating the point of
            the graph: to visualize the trend of diamond purchases over time. It
            also includes a dark, thick, dreaded grid in the form of fishnets
            (again, weird). Instead, Tufte writes grids should usually be muted
            or completely suppressed so they don’t compete with the data. Using
            grey instead of black is a good practice, and one I try to
            incorporate in my designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The grid and angle of the leg in this example also create an optical
            illusion called a “moiré effect,” which causes vibration of the eye
            and is generally painful to look at. Other examples of unintentional
            optical art include using cross-hatching or slanted lines as a fill.
            (Even though Tufte writes that patterns are chart-junk, I wonder if
            it’s not all bad to include faint patterns if it helps with
            accessibility, such as color blindness.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Tufte includes an excerpt from <em>Learning from Las Vegas</em>, which covers
            ducks in modern architecture: “It is alright to decorate
            construction, but never to construct decoration” (p. 117). Even
            though this quote is referring to architecture, it’s extremely
            relevant to graphics design, which is, I’m sure, why Tufte included
            it in his writing.
          </p>
          <img

          />
          <p class="caption">

            illustrate the concept of a graphical duck. (Amanda Weisbrod)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The best ways to avoid chart-junk and design with intention are to
            maximize the data-ink and data density of a display. To achieve
            optimal data density, one should look at the number of entries in
            the data matrix divided by the area of the data display. Tufte
            writes that data-dense designs give control of the information over
            to the readers, while data-thin displays move readers toward
            ignorance and passivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The assumption that charts are for readers who find text to be too
            difficult to understand results in designs that aim to entertain
            rather than inform. “Contempt for graphics and their audience leads
            to over-decorated and simplistic designs, tiny datasets and big
            lies,” (p. 81), according to Tufte. He goes on to explain that the
            skills, attitudes and organizational structure among those who
            design and edit are the primary causes of inept graphics.
          </p>
          <p>
            As this book was originally published in 1983 (I read the second
            edition, which was released in 2001), I feel we’ve come a long way
            in the field of data visualization, especially in the realm of news.
            Most designs I see published in major news outlets are sophisticated
            and explore data in meaningful ways, while avoiding chart-junk. I
            believe visual graphics journalists are now more in tune with
            statistics, and the myriad of intuitive tools available give easier
            access to statisticians to design graphics. We see a melding of the
            two professions in this case. I’d like to explore the trajectory of
            the visual data journalist profession over time — when it first
            emerged, and how it has boomed over time alongside the advancement
            of technology, particularly design programs — but I feel that’s
            another article to be written.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s all for now! Thanks for following along, and I’ll see you
            next time.
